## Project Overview
This repository contains the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignment for Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College. The assignment covers the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms, focusing on efficient time and space complexity.

## Assignment Details
- **Subject:** Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Institution:** Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College
- **Course:** B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering OR Information Technology
- **Instructor:** Dr. Dipak Kumar Kole (DKK)
- **Semester:** [Could be any from 3rd to 6th]

### Objectives
- To implement and analyze various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- To design and implement algorithms for sorting, searching, and other fundamental operations.
- To compare the time and space complexity of different algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++, C
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spexcher/DSA_Lab.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

      ```
    - For **C**:
      ```bash
      gcc -o output main.c
      ./output
      ```

## Data Structures Implemented
- **Arrays:** Implementation of dynamic arrays and operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Linked Lists:** Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list with various operations.
- **Stacks:** Implementation using arrays and linked lists, with push, pop, and peek operations.
- **Queues:** Implementation of simple queues and circular queues.
- **Trees:** Binary search tree, AVL tree, and operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Graphs:** Representation using adjacency matrix and adjacency list, along with BFS and DFS algorithms.

## Algorithms
