## Project Overview
This repository contains the Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) assignment for Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College. The assignment demonstrates the principles of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction through various classes and methods.

## Assignment Details
- **Subject:** Object-Oriented Programming System
- **Institution:** Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College
- **Course:** B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering OR Information Technology
- **Instructor:** [Dr. Dipak Kumar Kole (DKK)] in my case
- **Semester:** [Could be any from 3rd to 6th]

### Objectives
- To implement the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
- To design and develop classes and objects that demonstrate OOP principles.
- To create a working program that solves a specific problem using OOP techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** [Programming Language Used: C++, Java]
- **IDE:** [VS Code]

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spexcher/DSA_Lab.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd OOPS_Lab
    ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

4. Compile and run the program:
    - For **C++**: 
      ```bash
      g++ -o output main.cpp
      ./output
      ```
    - For **Java**:
      ```bash
      javac Main.java
      java Main
      ```

*Include a brief description of the class diagram or attach the image if you have one.*

## Features
- **Encapsulation:** Demonstrated by [Class Name].
- **Inheritance:** Implemented in [Class Name].
- **Polymorphism:** Achieved through [Class Name].
- **Abstraction:** Represented by [Class Name].
